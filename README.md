## 🚀 About Us
Ray’s Pressure Wash is a **one-man business built with hustle, dedication, and pride**.  
Founded by a young entrepreneur with a vision to create his own lane instead of waiting for opportunities,  
this company represents **hard work, resilience, and independence**.  

I started this business because jobs weren’t calling back. Instead of waiting,  
I picked up a machine and decided to build something for myself.

## 📖 Backstory
Growing up, I learned early that nothing comes easy.  
After multiple job applications with no luck, I chose to take a different path: **entrepreneurship**.  

With only a vision, limited resources, and the drive to succeed,  
I began building Ray’s Pressure Wash from scratch.  

This business is more than cleaning surfaces—it’s about **proving that with hard work and consistency, anyone can build their own future**.
